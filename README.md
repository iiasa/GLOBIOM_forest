# Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM) is a global spatially-explicit agricultural and forest sector model. GLOBIOM-forest is a simplified version of GLOBIOM that can be used for forest sector analysis. In GLOBIOM-forest the agricultural sector includes just one product (energy crops), but the forest sector is modelled in detailed including. The model is solved recursively for each 10-year period by maximizing the economic surplus. The supply side of the model is based on the 0.5Â° grid resolution while the demand side and trade on 59 economic regions.
